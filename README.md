This project was designed and created by me as a practical exercise for OOPS. I have used JAVA, which is my most preferred language for object-oriented programming. The project showcases my skills and proficiency in OOPS through the demonstration of several important OOPS related concepts including Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance etc. I have also employed a multi-layer, multi-file approach, wherein accounts of several users, be it a margin or trade account can be maintained. Further, it is divided into three layers namely Service, Repository and Accounts. Finally, there is a main presentation layer as a backend that integrates all the layers to present it in a user-friendly working format. The multi-layer approach is basically done to make the code more readable, manageable and easy to debug, as each functionality is a separate file. All the layers can be found in the “caps” folder.
