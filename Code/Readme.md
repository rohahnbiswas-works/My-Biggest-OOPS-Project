# My-Biggest-OOPS-Project
This project was created by me as a practice for OOPS. This project is created in JAVA which is my most preffered programming language for object oriented programming. This is just to showcase my skills and proficiency in OOPS because this project demonstartes many important OOPS related concepts including Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance etc. I have also utilized a multi layer multi file approach where the whole project is for maintaining the accounts of several users which can be a margin or trade account, and it is divided into three layers namely Service, Repository and Accounts Layer. At last there is a main presentation layer which brings all of these things together as a backend to present it in a human friendly working format for users.
